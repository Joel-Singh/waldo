- When the user uploads score
  - It has to upload the score to the database
  - Do nothing if the initials field is empty
    - Show a user error message
  - Whether initials already exist
    - Could just have multiple initials
    - Could tell the user to choose a different initials
  - Update the scoreboard to the left (rerun the effect?)
