# Waldo
This is my Where's Waldo game created as part of The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app).

## Technologies
- Create React App
- Plan css
- Jest for testing
- Javascript, however Typescript is used in places after coming back to the project
